# Comprehensive Medical Curriculum SAQs with Marking Schemas

## Question 1: Diabetes Insipidus Post-Pituitary Surgery

**Question:**
```
A 45-year-old man has arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency (diabetes insipidus) following previous surgery for a pituitary tumour. He is very dehydrated and thirsty. He has not had a drink for 6 hours and he has not had his usual medication for arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency prescribed.

Investigations:
Serum sodium      169 mmol/L    (135 - 145)
Serum potassium   4.9 mmol/L    (3.5 - 4.9)
Serum urea        30.0 mmol/L   (2.5 - 7.0)
Serum creatinine  360 μmol/L    (60 - 120)

i) What incident report form should be completed following this adverse event? (½ mark)

ii) State the main purpose of completing this form. (½ mark)

Essay answer: [800 characters maximum]
```

**Marking Schema:**
```
i) What incident report form should be completed following this adverse event? (½ mark)
- DATIX (½ mark)

ii) State the main purpose of completing this form. (½ mark)
Award ½ mark for any one of the following:
- To learn from incidents
- To improve patient safety
- To reduce the risk of future harm
Accept other responses that convey a similar meaning.

DO NOT ACCEPT:
- Never event
- To report that this event shouldn't have happened and was a mistake and to learn to avoid it for next time
- To punish staff involved

Rationale:
This question assesses students' knowledge of patient safety reporting systems (DATIX) and understanding of the purpose of incident reporting in healthcare improvement. Students should recognize that incident reporting is primarily a learning and safety improvement tool rather than a punitive measure. This aligns with national patient safety frameworks and GMC guidance on professional practice.

## Question 2: Inguinal Hernia Management

**Question:**
```
A 65-year-old man is referred to the surgical outpatient clinic with a 6-month history of a right groin lump. He first noticed the lump 6 months ago but it has more recently started to cause intermittent discomfort in the groin. The discomfort is exacerbated by physical exertion and relieved by resting.

He takes amlodipine for hypertension.

An inguinal hernia is suspected.

A diagnosis of inguinal hernia is confirmed and the patient is listed for a laparoscopic mesh repair of the hernia.

As part of the consent for surgery discussion, the risks of laparoscopic hernia repair are explained to the patient.

Apart from bleeding and infection, state three procedure-specific risks that may occur intra-operatively or in the immediate post-operative period.
(3 x 1 mark)

Essay answer: [800 characters maximum]
```

**Marking Schema:**
```
Apart from bleeding and infection, state three procedure-specific risks that may occur intra-operatively or in the immediate post-operative period (3 x 1 mark):

Award 1 mark each for any three of the following:
- Strangulation or incarceration
- Bowel obstruction
- Re-appearance of the hernia
- Conversion to open repair
- Urinary retention
- Injury to vas deferens or testicular artery
- Nerve damage (to the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, genitofemoral or lateral femoral cutaneous nerves)
- Injury related to port insertion to hernia contents or to surrounding structures (blood vessels, bladder or bowel)

DO NOT ACCEPT:
- Bruising/swelling (as question states apart from bleeding)
- Surgical site infection (as question states apart from infection)
- Seroma (not immediate)
- Recurrence of hernia, incisional hernia, chronic pain, mesh migration or erosion (not immediate post-operative)

Rationale:
This question assesses understanding of specific surgical complications related to laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, distinguishing between immediate/early risks and later complications. Students should demonstrate knowledge of anatomical structures at risk during the procedure and potential mechanical complications. This aligns with surgical curricula guidelines on informed consent and complication awareness.
```

## Question 3: Peripheral Vascular Disease

**Question:**
```
A 54-year-old man has a 1-month history of pain in his right calf on walking 100 metres. The pain goes away after 3 minutes if he stands still, but then reappears after 100 metres if he starts walking again. There is no thigh or buttock pain. He has no previous medical history.

His BP is 128/76 mmHg. His BMI is 24 kg/m².

His HbA1c is 34 mmol/L (20 - 42)

A diagnosis of intermittent claudication is made.

The patient does not take his doctor's advice in respect of modifying his risk factors and 4 months later develops rest pain in his right lower limb.

Where in the lower limb does rest pain most typically occur? (1 mark)

Essay answer: [600 characters maximum]
```

**Marking Schema:**
```
Where in the lower limb does rest pain most typically occur? (1 mark)

Award 1 mark for any one of the following:
- Toes
- Foot
- Forefoot

DO NOT ACCEPT:
- Calf
- Thigh
- Buttock
- Ankle
- Leg (too vague)

Rationale:
This question tests understanding of the clinical progression of peripheral arterial disease from intermittent claudication to critical limb ischemia with rest pain. Students should recognize that rest pain typically affects the most distal parts of the limb first due to compromised perfusion in end-arteries. This aligns with vascular medicine principles and understanding of the natural history of untreated peripheral vascular disease.
```

## Question 4: Chronic Kidney Disease Management

**Question:**
```
A 32-year-old man attends the renal clinic with a new diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease had been discovered incidentally during a routine medical assessment for a new job. He is asymptomatic and feels otherwise fit and well. He is not taking any regular medications, has no significant past medical history or family history of kidney disease.

The patient's kidney disease continues to progress and he is told he will need renal replacement therapy.

State three different options available to him. Other than infection, state a common complication associated with each. (6 x ½ mark)

Essay answer: [800 characters maximum]
```

**Marking Schema:**
```
State three different options available to him. Other than infection, state a common complication associated with each. (6 x ½ mark)

Award ½ mark for each type of renal replacement therapy and a further ½ mark for a common complication of that method of RRT, maximum 3 marks.

- Haemodialysis (½ mark) - Any one of the following complications for ½ mark: Access failure (failed AV fistula/dialysis line), Low blood pressure on dialysis, Thrombosis in fistula, Steal syndrome
- Peritoneal dialysis (½ mark) - Any one of the following complications for ½ mark: Access failure (PD tube not working), PD fluid leak, (Sclerosing) peritonitis, Hernia formation
- Renal transplant (½ mark) - Any one of the following complications for ½ mark: Graft failure, Rejection, Long-term risk of cancer (except lymphoma and SCC)

Consider reasonable alternatives for common complications.

DO NOT ACCEPT:
- Conservative management (as the question states he needs renal replacement therapy)
- Infection (as question states apart from infection)

Rationale:
This question assesses understanding of renal replacement therapy options and their associated complications. Students should demonstrate knowledge of both the available treatment modalities and their specific risk profiles, which is essential for properly counseling patients. This aligns with nephrology clinical practice guidelines on patient education for renal replacement therapy decision-making.

## UKMLA-Aligned Question Development Framework

When creating medical SAQs aligned with the UKMLA framework, focus on:

## Core Principles
1. **Clinical relevance**: Use common presentations and important conditions that reflect current practice standards such as NICE Guidelines
2. **Clear scenario construction**: Present realistic cases with appropriate complexity for training level
3. **Specific questioning**: Test application, analysis, and synthesis rather than factual recall
4. **Fair marking criteria**: Ensure schemas reward clinical reasoning and allow for evidence-based alternatives
5. **Educational value**: Reinforce core clinical concepts, patient safety, and interprofessional practice

## Domains to Address
Questions should assess competencies across the following domains:
- **Knowledge application**: Basic science principles applied to clinical situations
- **Clinical reasoning**: From symptom to diagnosis to management
- **Technical skills**: Procedures, investigations, and interpretation
- **Communication skills**: Patient interactions, documentation, handover
- **Professional values**: Ethics, law, leadership, and teamwork
- **Systems-based practice**: Healthcare systems, quality improvement, patient safety

## Progressive Complexity
- **Early years**: Focus on normal structure/function and pathophysiology with straightforward presentations
- **Middle years**: Common conditions with typical presentations and standard management approaches
- **Final years**: Complex scenarios, atypical presentations, and management nuances

## Question Construction Best Practices
- Use clear language without unnecessary jargon
- Include only relevant information while avoiding red herrings
- Present realistic laboratory values with reference ranges
- Test multiple cognitive domains within each scenario
- Incorporate professional dilemmas when appropriate
- Assess understanding of evidence-based practice

## Global Health and Diversity Considerations
- Include diverse patient demographics and presentations
- Consider social determinants of health where relevant
- Address cultural factors that influence health and healthcare
- Include global health perspectives on disease management

Remember to align questions with contemporary practice standards and educational outcomes expected of newly qualified doctors.
